# Boids
Boids project for IMAC

# Subject

Your task is to design an animation where each boid is a given word chosen in a provided list. These words refer to climate communication studies. The aim is to create a front image for a project grounded in media literacy.

The context is given here:

> Swarm is a follow-up to the Critical Climate Machine research project which involves revealing and quantifying misinformation about global warming. By extension, Swarm is a research on media literacy consisting of a critical study of climate denial in three languages: English, French, Spanish. The project results in an open dataset published online.

Particular constraints: words in bright colors on dark background; maximum three colors; dimensions are 640*480; the loop should be infinite; the gif should be between 10 and 20 seconds. In a few lines, justify your design. Best three projects will be showcased at Cité des sciences "Weekend Ingénieurs Créatifs".


# Artistic intent of the project

The objective of this project was to make a work of art to raise awareness on a current topic: misinformation on climate change. 

To do this, our first intention was to represent heat exchange, using two colours: red and blue,
to obviously evoke heat and cold. Secondly, we added a trail effect (or blur) on the texts to remind us of the lack of
of concentration in our society. Indeed, we live at an increasingly frantic pace, with a massive amount of information arriving in an increasingly short space of time. 
in a shorter and shorter period of time. It is therefore with the surplus of text and this drag effect that we wanted to criticise this daily phenomenon.

Finally, in the background, we placed two images of nature (ocean and forest), alternating every five seconds. The aim here was 
to remind us that, despite the omnipresence of information, humanity tends to put aside the very principle of the fight that must be waged: to preserve nature, not to forget it and to put it in the 
The aim here was to remind us that, despite this omnipresence of information, humanity tends to put aside the very principle of the fight that must be waged: to preserve nature, not to forget it and to put it in the shade, rather than fighting for words.
